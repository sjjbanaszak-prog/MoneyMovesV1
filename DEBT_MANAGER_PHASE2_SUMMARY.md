## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### Chart Library Choice
- **Recharts** selected for consistency with:
  - MortgageChart.js
  - SavingsChart.js
  - PensionReturnsChart.js
  - NetWorthChart.js

### State Management
- Local state with `useState` for Phase 2A
- Firestore integration planned for Phase 2B
- No Redux needed (React state sufficient)

### Data Flow
```
Debts → calculateSnowballStrategy() → strategyResult
Debts → calculateAvalancheStrategy() → strategyResult
Debts → compareStrategies() → comparison
↓
RepaymentTimelineChart (uses strategyResult)
StrategyComparisonChart (uses comparison)
DebtAdvisorPanel (uses debts, strategyResult, comparison)
```

### Calculation Efficiency
- `useMemo` prevents recalculation on every render
- Calculations only run when dependencies change:
  - `debts` array
  - `strategy` selection
  - `monthlyBudget` value

---

## 🎓 Learning & Best Practices

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental development** - Build, test, integrate
2. **Component isolation** - Each chart is self-contained
3. **Consistent styling** - All use CSS variables
4. **Data validation** - Charts handle empty/error states gracefully

### Code Quality
- **DRY principle** - Shared utilities in `debtUtils.js`
- **Single responsibility** - Each component has one job
- **PropTypes** ready (add if needed)
- **Accessibility** - Semantic HTML, ARIA labels possible
