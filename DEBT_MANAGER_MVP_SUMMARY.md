---

### Step 2: Financial Logic & Testing

#### **debtUtils.js** - Core Calculation Engine
Comprehensive utility functions for debt repayment calculations:

**Functions Implemented**:
1. `calculateMonthlyPayment()` - Amortization formula for monthly payments
2. `generateAmortizationSchedule()` - Full payment schedule generation
3. `calculateSnowballStrategy()` - Lowest balance first strategy
4. `calculateAvalancheStrategy()` - Highest interest first strategy
5. `compareStrategies()` - Side-by-side comparison with savings analysis
6. `calculateProgress()` - Progress tracking metrics
7. `validateDebt()` - Input validation with detailed error messages

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Accurate UK interest calculations (monthly compounding)
- ✅ Waterfall payment allocation (minimums first, then extra)
- ✅ Detects impossible scenarios (payment < interest)
- ✅ Handles edge cases (zero interest, zero balance)
- ✅ Rounds all currency to 2 decimal places

#### **debtUtils.test.js** - Comprehensive Test Suite
**Test Coverage**: 22 tests, 100% passing

**Test Categories**:
- ✅ Monthly payment calculations (4 tests)
- ✅ Amortization schedules (3 tests)
- ✅ Snowball strategy (3 tests)
- ✅ Avalanche strategy (2 tests)
- ✅ Strategy comparison (3 tests)
- ✅ Progress tracking (2 tests)
- ✅ Input validation (5 tests)

**Example Validated Scenarios**:
- £5,000 debt at 18.9% APR over 24 months = £251.80/month
- Payment below interest charges detected and rejected
- Snowball prioritizes smallest balance first
- Avalanche saves more interest than Snowball

---

### Step 3: Firestore Schema & Security

#### **FIRESTORE_DEBT_SCHEMA.md** - Complete Data Architecture
Detailed schema documentation for Phase 1 (MVP) and Phase 2 (Spending Analysis).

**Phase 1 - MVP Schema** (Implemented):
- **Collection**: `userDebts/{userId}`
  - Main document with debts array, strategy, budget, preferences
  - User-scoped by Firebase Auth UID
  - Timestamps for created/updated tracking

- **Subcollection**: `repayment_schedules/{scheduleId}`
  - Calculated schedules for each strategy
  - Month-by-month payment breakdown
  - Per-debt payoff projections

**Phase 2 - Future Enhancement** (Documented):
- **Subcollection**: `statements/{statementId}` - Uploaded credit card/loan statements
- **Subcollection**: `transactions/{transactionId}` - AI-categorized spending data
- **Category Taxonomy**: 15+ spending categories with icons

**Security Rules**:
```javascript
// User can only read/write their own data
match /userDebts/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(userId);

  match /repayment_schedules/{scheduleId} {
    allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(userId);
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Application Integration

#### **App.js** - Routing Configuration
- ✅ Imported `DebtManager` component
- ✅ Added protected route: `/debt-manager`
- ✅ Integrated with existing authentication flow

#### **Navbar.js** - Navigation Updates
- ✅ Added `FiCreditCard` icon import
- ✅ Added "Debt Manager" link to `navLinks` array
- ✅ Icon displays in both mobile and desktop navigation

## 📊 Financial Calculations - How They Work

### Snowball Strategy
1. Sort debts by balance (lowest first)
2. Pay minimums on all debts
3. Apply extra budget to smallest debt
4. Once paid off, roll payment to next smallest
5. Repeat until all debts cleared

**Benefit**: Quick psychological wins, momentum building

### Avalanche Strategy
1. Sort debts by interest rate (highest first)
2. Pay minimums on all debts
3. Apply extra budget to highest rate debt
4. Once paid off, roll payment to next highest rate
5. Repeat until all debts cleared

**Benefit**: Lowest total interest, maximum savings

### Example Calculation
**Debts**:
- Credit Card A: £3,000 @ 18.9% APR, £90 minimum
- Credit Card B: £1,000 @ 22.9% APR, £30 minimum
- Personal Loan: £5,000 @ 8.5% APR, £150 minimum

**Budget**: £400/month
**Minimums**: £270/month
**Extra**: £130/month

**Snowball** (smallest first):
- Target: Credit Card B (£1,000)
- Payment: £30 + £130 = £160/month
- Result: Card B paid off in 7 months

**Avalanche** (highest rate first):
- Target: Credit Card B (22.9% rate)
- Payment: £30 + £130 = £160/month
- Result: Card B paid off in 7 months, but saves more overall interest

## 🎨 Design System Compliance

All components follow Money Moves design standards:

### Color Semantics
- **Green (#22c55e)**: Low interest, success, progress
- **Amber (#fbbf24)**: Medium interest, warnings
- **Red (#ef4444)**: High interest, urgent attention
- **Blue (#3b82f6)**: Primary actions, interactive elements

### UI Patterns
- ✅ Numeric summary cards for key metrics
- ✅ Sortable tables with column headers
- ✅ Toggle selection for strategies
- ✅ Progress bars with percentage indicators
- ✅ Dynamic recalculation on input changes
- ✅ Color-coded interest rate badges

### Responsive Design
- ✅ Desktop: Multi-column layouts, hover states
- ✅ Tablet: Adaptive grids
- ✅ Mobile: Stacked layouts, full-width buttons, card-based tables

### CSS Variables
All components use shared CSS variables:
- `--card-bg`, `--text-primary`, `--border-color`
- `--primary-color`, `--success-color`, `--warning-color`
- `--spacing-*`, `--padding-*`, `--text-*`, `--font-*`

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Local State First?
The MVP uses React local state (`useState`) rather than Firestore to:
- Enable rapid prototyping and iteration
- Allow testing financial logic in isolation
- Provide immediate user feedback without network latency
- Simplify debugging during development

**Migration Path**: Phase 2 will integrate `useFirebaseDoc` hook for persistence while maintaining the same component interfaces.

### Why Snowball AND Avalanche?
Both strategies are valid and serve different user needs:
- **Avalanche** is mathematically optimal (lowest interest)
- **Snowball** provides psychological wins (quicker payoffs)

Research shows Snowball users are more likely to stick with their plan, even if Avalanche saves more money. We provide both and let users choose.

### Why MVP-First Approach?
Following CLAUDE.md principles:
1. **Validate core logic** - Ensure calculations are correct before building UI
2. **Test thoroughly** - 100% test coverage on financial logic
3. **Iterate incrementally** - Add visualizations and uploads in Phase 2
4. **Ship working software** - Users can benefit from MVP immediately
