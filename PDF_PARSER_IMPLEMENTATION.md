### 1. New Files Created

#### `/src/modules/utils/pensionPdfParser.js` (Enhanced Parser)
**Purpose**: Core PDF/image parsing engine with OCR support

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ File size validation (10MB max)
- ✅ Enhanced UK pension provider detection (24 providers)
- ✅ Progress callback support for real-time UX updates
- ✅ Document-level provider detection (better accuracy)
- ✅ Table structure detection
- ✅ Data validation and cleaning with duplicate removal
- ✅ Quality scoring system (0-100)
- ✅ Multiple date format parsing (9 formats supported)
- ✅ Amount validation (£1 - £100,000 range)
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with user-friendly guidance

**Supported File Types**:
- Digital PDFs (text extraction via PDF.js)
- Scanned PDFs (OCR via Tesseract.js)
- Images: JPG, PNG, HEIC (OCR via Tesseract.js)

**UK Pension Providers Recognized**:
```javascript
[
  'aviva', 'royal london', 'aegon', 'scottish widows',
  'legal & general', 'l&g', 'nest', 'peoples pension',
  "people's pension", 'standard life', 'phoenix',
  'prudential', 'now pensions', 'aon', 'scottish friendly',
  'true potential', 'quilter', 'fidelity', 'vanguard',
  'hargreaves lansdown', 'hl sipp', 'stakeholder',
  'workplace pension', 'auto enrolment'
]
```

**Date Formats Supported**:
- DD/MM/YYYY (UK standard)
- DD-MM-YYYY
- DD.MM.YYYY
- MM/DD/YYYY (US format)
- YYYY-MM-DD (ISO format)
- YYYY/MM/DD
- DD/MM/YY (2-digit year)
- DD-MM-YY
- MM/DD/YY

**Data Quality Scoring**:
```javascript
Quality = (Validity Score × 0.7) + (Provider Detection Score × 0.3)

- Validity Score: % of rows with valid dates and amounts
- Provider Detection Score: % of rows with known providers
- Result: 0-100 quality metric
```

**Error Handling**:
- File size exceeded: Clear message with actual vs max size
- No data found: Guidance to check file contents
- Low quality (<30%): Suggests clearer scan or different format
- Corrupted PDFs: User-friendly error messages
- OCR failures: Recommendations for image quality improvement

#### `/src/modules/PdfPensionUploader.js` (UI Component)
**Purpose**: User interface for PDF/image upload matching Money Moves design system

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking with visual feedback
- ✅ Stage-based progress messages (loading, extracting, OCR, parsing)
- ✅ Progress bar with percentage (0-100%)
- ✅ OCR warning messages (30-60 second wait time)
- ✅ File size display
- ✅ Error handling with descriptive messages
- ✅ Matches IntelligentFileUploader design patterns
- ✅ Transforms extracted data to match MappingReviewModal format
- ✅ Quality threshold enforcement (minimum 30% quality)

**Progress Stages**:
1. **Loading**: Initial file processing
2. **Extracting**: Text extraction from digital PDFs (pages X of Y)
3. **OCR**: Optical character recognition for scanned docs/images
4. **Parsing**: Data structure analysis and extraction
5. **Complete**: Successful completion

**Data Transformation**:
- Converts parser output to format expected by MappingReviewModal

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Upload Flow

1. **User clicks "Upload Pension Data" button**
   - Opens file type selector modal

2. **User selects file type**:

   **Option A: CSV or Excel**
   - Opens `IntelligentFileUploader`
   - Parses with PapaParse/XLSX
   - Shows `MappingReviewModal` for column mapping
   - Processes with `processPensionUpload`

   **Option B: PDF or Photo**
   - Opens `PdfPensionUploader`
   - Parses with `pensionPdfParser` (PDF.js + Tesseract.js)
   - Shows real-time progress (extraction, OCR, parsing)
   - Transforms data to match expected format
   - Shows `MappingReviewModal` for review
   - Processes with `processPensionUpload`

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Both upload types converge at `MappingReviewModal`
   - User reviews detected columns and provider
   - Confirms or adjusts mappings
   - Data is processed identically regardless of source

4. **Final Integration**:
   - Provider data is merged with existing pensions
   - Payment histories are combined and sorted
   - Yearly totals are recalculated
   - Data is saved to Firestore
   - UI updates with new data

### Data Format Compatibility

Both upload types produce the same data structure:

```javascript
{
  rawData: [
    {
      date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
      amount: 123.45,
      provider: "Provider Name",
      description: "Payment description"
    },
    // ...
  ],
  headers: ["date", "amount", "provider", "description"],
  initialMapping: {
    date: "date",
    amount: "amount",
    provider: "provider",
    description: "description",
    dateFormat: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  },
  detectedProvider: {
    name: "Provider Name",
    confidence: 85,
    requiresConfirmation: false
  },
  aiMetadata: {
    mappingConfidence: 0.85,
    dateFormatConfidence: 1.0,
    frequency: "monthly",
    source: "pdf-parser" or "heuristic",
    dataQuality: 85,
    stats: { /* extraction statistics */ }
  }
}
```

## Technical Architecture

- Normalized to YYYY-MM-DD for consistency

**Amounts**:
- Must be numeric
- Range: £1 - £100,000 (reasonable pension contributions)
- Removes £ symbols, commas, spaces
- Validates precision (2 decimal places)

**Providers**:
- Checks against 24 known UK providers

const key = `${row.date}-${row.amount}`;
```

### Quality Scoring

- Minimum quality threshold: 30%
- Below 30%: Extraction rejected with error message
- 30-50%: Low quality warning (user can proceed)
- 50-80%: Medium quality (user confirmation suggested)
- 80-100%: High quality (automatic acceptance)

## Performance Optimization

### Future Enhancements

1. **OCR Optimization**:
   - Consider server-side OCR for faster processing
   - Implement image pre-processing (brightness, contrast)
   - Use progressive rendering for multi-page PDFs

2. **Caching**:
   - Cache OCR results to prevent re-processing
   - Store parser templates per provider

3. **Provider Detection**:
   - Add machine learning for provider recognition
   - Build provider-specific parsing rules
   - Improve confidence scoring with feedback loop

4. **Table Detection**:
   - Enhance table structure detection
   - Support more complex layouts
   - Handle merged cells and wrapped text

## Security Considerations

**File Processing**:
- Files processed client-side (no server upload)
- No data leaves user's browser during parsing
- Firestore saves only extracted structured data
- Original files not stored

**Input Validation**:
- File size limits enforced
- File type validation
- Amount range validation (prevents injection)
- Date format validation

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with PDF upload feature
- [ ] Update README.md with new upload capabilities
- [ ] Create user guide for PDF/image uploads
- [ ] Document provider list for future additions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Known Limitations

1. **OCR Accuracy**:
   - Dependent on image quality
   - May struggle with handwritten notes
   - Complex table layouts may reduce accuracy

2. **Provider Detection**:
   - Limited to 24 pre-defined UK providers
   - Unknown providers labeled as "Unknown Provider"
   - Manual correction available via mapping modal

3. **Date Format Detection**:
   - Assumes standard formats
   - May require manual correction for unusual formats

4. **Performance**:
   - OCR takes 30-60 seconds per page
   - Large PDFs (10+ pages) may take several minutes
   - Browser tab must remain active during processing
